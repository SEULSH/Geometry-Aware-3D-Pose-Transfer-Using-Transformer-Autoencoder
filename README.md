# Geometry-Aware-3D-Pose-Transfer-Using-Transformer-Autoencoder

The implementation code of the paper "Geometry-Aware 3D Pose Transfer Using Transformer Autoencoder"

The human and animal data are same to that in NPT (https://github.com/jiashunwang/Neural-Pose-Transfer) and 3D-CoreNet (https://github.com/ChaoyueSong/3d-corenet).

The XCA block is basically from the code of Topology-Independent-3D-Shape-Models-Using-Transformers (https://github.com/tensimiku/Topology-Independent-3D-Shape-Models-Using-Transformers).
